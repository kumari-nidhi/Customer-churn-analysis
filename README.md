## **Overview**
This project focuses on understanding the factors that drive customer churn in a telecom company. Churn is defined as the percentage of customers that stop using the company's services within a given time period. By analyzing various customer-related features such as contract type, monthly charges, and internet services, we aim to derive actionable insights.

The analysis utilizes visualizations, statistical methods, and machine learning algorithms to:
- **Identify customer demographics** more likely to churn.
- **Analyze service-related features** and their impact on churn.
- **Provide recommendations** to reduce churn and improve customer retention.
